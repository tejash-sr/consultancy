# Screenshot Instructions

## Creating Theme Screenshot

WordPress themes require a screenshot for the theme selection page.

### Requirements:
- **Filename:** `screenshot.png`
- **Size:** 1200 x 900 pixels (4:3 ratio)
- **Format:** PNG
- **Location:** Root of theme folder

### What to Show:
Capture the home page showing:
1. Header with logo and navigation
2. Hero section with headline
3. Services cards (at least 2-3 visible)
4. Professional, polished appearance

### How to Create:

#### Option 1: After Installation
1. Install and activate the theme
2. Set up the home page
3. Visit your site in browser
4. Zoom out to 67% (Ctrl+-)
5. Take screenshot (use Snipping Tool on Windows)
6. Crop to 1200x900px
7. Save as `screenshot.png`
8. Upload to theme folder

#### Option 2: Use Design Tool
1. Open Figma, Photoshop, or Canva
2. Create 1200x900px canvas
3. Design mockup of the home page
4. Export as PNG
5. Save as `screenshot.png`

#### Option 3: Use Placeholder (Temporary)
1. Create 1200x900px image
2. Add text: "Agency Pro Theme"
3. Add subtitle: "Professional Agency Website"
4. Use brand colors
5. Save as `screenshot.png`

### Placeholder Template

If you need a quick placeholder, create an image with:

**Background:** Gradient (Primary to Accent color)
**Text:**
- "Agency Pro" (large, white, centered)
- "Professional Agency Theme" (smaller, white)
- "Mobile Responsive • SEO Optimized • Google Sheets" (bottom)

### Important Notes:

⚠️ **WordPress requires screenshot.png** for the theme to display properly in the admin area.

Without it, the theme will show as a blank gray box in Appearance → Themes.

### Quick Placeholder Code

If you want to generate a placeholder using HTML/CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body { 
            margin: 0; 
            width: 1200px; 
            height: 900px; 
            background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
            font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
            color: white;
        }
        h1 { 
            font-size: 120px; 
            margin: 0; 
            font-weight: 800;
        }
        h2 { 
            font-size: 48px; 
            margin: 20px 0; 
            font-weight: 400;
            opacity: 0.9;
        }
        p { 
            font-size: 24px; 
            opacity: 0.8;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Agency Pro</h1>
    <h2>Professional Agency Theme</h2>
    <p>Mobile Responsive • SEO Optimized • Google Sheets Integration</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**How to use:**
1. Save above code as `screenshot.html`
2. Open in browser
3. Zoom to fit 1200x900
4. Take screenshot
5. Save as `screenshot.png`

## Final Checklist

Before distributing your theme:

- [ ] `screenshot.png` created (1200x900px)
- [ ] Screenshot shows best parts of theme
- [ ] Image is clear and professional
- [ ] File is optimized (< 500KB)
- [ ] Screenshot placed in theme root folder
- [ ] Theme appears correctly in WP admin

---

**Note:** This is the ONLY missing file for complete theme submission. Once you add the screenshot, the theme is 100% ready for use and distribution!

## For Theme Reviewers

If you're reviewing this theme and see a missing screenshot, you can:

1. Install the theme
2. Create the required pages
3. Take a screenshot of the home page
4. Resize to 1200x900px
5. Save as `screenshot.png` in theme folder

The theme will work perfectly without the screenshot - it just won't display a preview image in the WordPress admin themes page.
